## The Reverse Booking Concept - Prior Attempts

### Priceline "Name Your Own Price" (Global)

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Concept | Bid on hotels, airlines |
| Outcome | **Discontinued** in 2016 |
| Why it failed | Hotels didn't want price transparency; complex UX |

### Hotwire "Hot Deals" (Global)

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Concept | Hidden hotel names until booking (for discounts) |
| Outcome | Still exists but niche |
| Why limited | Travelers want to know what they're booking |

### India-specific Attempts

| Player | Attempt | Outcome |
|--------|---------|---------|
| ixigo | Fare alerts, price predictions | Works for flights, not hotels |
| Various startups | Reverse bidding | All failed or pivoted |

### Why Reverse Booking Hasn't Worked

1. **Hotels don't want to bid manually** — Labor-intensive, inconsistent
2. **Price cannibalization** — Other guests see lower prices
3. **Rate parity agreements** — OTA contracts restrict pricing
4. **Traveler trust** — Prefer known prices, reviews, cancellation policies
5. **Timing mismatch** — Hotels want bookings in advance, not last-minute bids

## Traveler Behavior (India)

### How Indians Book Hotels Today

```
DISCOVERY (1-4 weeks before)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• Instagram/YouTube: "Best places to visit in Goa"
• Google: "Goa hotels with pool"
• Friends/family: WhatsApp recommendations

COMPARISON (1-2 weeks before)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• Open MakeMyTrip, Booking.com, Goibibo, Agoda
• Compare prices, reviews, photos
• Check cancellation policies

BOOKING (days before)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• Book on OTA with best price
• OR call hotel directly for "direct booking discount"
• WhatsApp hotel for queries

POST-TRIP
━━━━━━━━━
• Post photos on Instagram
• Maybe leave Google review (rarely)
```

### Key Insights

| Behavior | Implication |
|----------|-------------|
| Price comparison is easy | Your reverse bidding doesn't add much value |
| Trust is paramount | New platform has zero trust |
| WhatsApp is preferred | For hotel communication, not apps |
| Reviews matter a lot | You have no reviews initially |
| Cancellation policy matters | OTAs have standardized this |

## Hotel Behavior (India)

### How Hotels Get Bookings Today

```
CHANNEL MIX (Typical Independent Hotel)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

OTAs (MakeMyTrip, Booking):     40-50%
Direct (website, WhatsApp):     20-30%
Walk-ins:                       10-20%
Corporate/groups:               10-20%
Travel agents:                  5-10%
```

### Hotel Pain Points

| Pain | Severity | Your Solution? |
|------|----------|----------------|
| High OTA commissions (15-25%) | High | Maybe (but you'll charge too) |
| Vacant rooms (last-minute) | High | Reverse bidding could help |
| No direct customer relationship | Medium | Not solved by your platform |
| Rate parity pressure | High | Not addressed |
| Review management | Medium | Not addressed |

### Why Hotels Might NOT Use Your Platform

1. **Already overwhelmed with channels** — Another platform to manage
2. **Manual bidding is labor-intensive** — Who will monitor and respond?
3. **Price transparency risk** — Don't want to show they'll accept lower prices
4. **Commission fatigue** — If you charge commission, same problem as OTAs
5. **Trust issue** — Will travelers actually book? Fake inquiries?

## Market Opportunity Assessment

### The Vacancy Problem (Potential Opportunity)

```
INDIAN HOTEL VACANCY MATH
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

150,000 hotels × 20 avg rooms = 3,000,000 room-nights/day
35% vacancy rate = 1,050,000 empty rooms/day
Average room rate: ₹2,000
Daily revenue lost: ₹210 Cr
Annual revenue lost: ₹76,650 Cr (~$9B)

EVEN 1% OF THIS = ₹766 Cr OPPORTUNITY
```

### But Here's the Problem

| Opportunity | Challenge |
|-------------|-----------|
| Huge vacancy | Hotels already discount on OTAs |
| Last-minute deals | Hotwire/OTA "tonight deals" exist |
| Price flexibility | Rate parity prevents differential pricing |
| Direct relationships | Hotels try, travelers still use OTAs |

### Realistic Addressable Market

| Segment | Size | Likelihood to Use |
|---------|------|-------------------|
| Independent budget hotels | Large | Low (tech-unsavvy) |
| Boutique/mid-range | Medium | Medium (need differentiation) |
| Resorts with vacancy | Medium | Medium (seasonal) |
| New/unknown properties | Small | High (desperate for bookings) |
| Homestays/B&Bs | Growing | High (underserved) |

**Realistic initial market**: Boutique hotels, homestays, new properties
**Size**: Maybe ₹1,000-2,000 Cr bookable inventory
