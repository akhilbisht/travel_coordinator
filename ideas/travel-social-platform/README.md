# Travel Social Platform + Reverse Hotel Booking

> A social media for travelers where hotels compete for customers

## The Idea

A platform combining:
1. **Social media for travelers** — Share trips, itineraries, photos, recommendations
2. **Hotel/resort marketplace** — Properties list themselves, fill vacant inventory
3. **Reverse booking** — Travelers post requirements (location, dates, budget), hotels bid with offers

### Core Use Case

```
TRAVELER POSTS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
"Looking for a resort in Goa
 Dec 24-26 (2 nights)
 Budget: ₹3,000-5,000/night
 Need: Pool, beach access, couple-friendly"

HOTELS RESPOND:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🏨 Resort A: "₹4,200/night - Pool villa, 100m from beach, breakfast included"
🏨 Resort B: "₹3,800/night - Sea-view room, complimentary dinner"
🏨 Resort C: "₹4,500/night - Private pool, spa credit ₹2,000"

TRAVELER PICKS THE BEST OFFER
```
